 Am I The Ass Hole for reminding my mother she's only in America because of me after she voted for Trump?
I was born in Czechoslovakia in 1989, pre Czech Republic, and now Czechia. I'm an American citizen through my dad. My mother and I moved to Florida in 1996. She got Natralized, then we moved my grandma and great grandma (a holocaust survivour) over. Both are also now citizens. And what does my mom do? Become a confederate flag waving, Trump supporting, immigration hating person. YOURE AN IMMIGRANT AND YOURE ONLY HERE BECAUSE OF ME!!!!!!!!! She says she likes his policies. One of his policies is sending you back to Europe! Nothing got through to her. So I told her to call me from Europe when she got deported. Am I The Ass Hole?

ETA: Before you say karma farming or lying. I've been on here for years and talk about being Czech multiple times.
